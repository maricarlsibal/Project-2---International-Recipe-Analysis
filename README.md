# Project 2: International Recipe Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing international recipes scraped from [AllRecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/). The objective is to explore global culinary patterns and answer data-driven questions through web scraping and visual analysis.

The project is divided into two main parts:
- **Part 1:** Selecting the dataset, formulating analytical questions, and identifying the website for scraping.
- **Part 2:** Performing web scraping using Python, cleaning and structuring the data, conducting exploratory data analysis, and generating visualizations.

## Repository Contents
- `Project 2, Part 1 - Questions and Dataset Selection.ipynb`  
  Describes the project goals, selected recipe categories (based on international cuisine), and outlines the specific questions to be answered through analysis.

- `Project 2, Part 2 - Web Scraped Data Analysis and Visualizations.ipynb`  
  Contains the scraping code, data processing steps, analysis, and visualizations (e.g., ingredient frequency, cooking time distributions).
