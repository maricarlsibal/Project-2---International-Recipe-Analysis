    "- Preparation and Cook Times: Found in \"prepTime\" and \"cookTime\" (in ISO 8601 duration format)\n",
    "- User Ratings and Review Counts: Stored under the \"aggregateRating\" object\n",
    "- Nutritional Information: Contained in the \"nutrition\" object (e.g., \"calories\", \"fatContent\", \"proteinContent\", etc.)\n",
